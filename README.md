# exim

A so hacky that it should've been a bash script golang program for parsing exim4 logs to pull a csv of emails against their "owners".

## Purpose

If you have logs from an exim4 email server and want to be able to pull all the emails that corresponded grouped against an internal email address set (defined by regex) then this is the tool for you.

There is absolutely 0 chance this is particularly performant.
